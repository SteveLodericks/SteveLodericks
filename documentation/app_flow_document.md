# App Flow Document for SteveLodericks GitHub Profile

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A brand-new visitor discovers the profile by navigating to `https://github.com/SteveLodericks`. They simply arrive on the public landing page and see the content of the `README.md` file rendered automatically. There is no special application installation or setup required for viewing this page. If the visitor wants to interact beyond browsing, they must sign in to GitHub. Signing in involves entering an email or username and password on GitHub’s login form, or using a supported social login option if previously configured. In the event a user forgets their password, a “Forgot password?” link guides them through entering their email to receive recovery instructions. Once signed in, a user can star or follow the profile, or if they are the owner, they can modify the repository. Signing out is done via the GitHub account menu in the header.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user lands on the GitHub dashboard. From here, they can access their own repositories or navigate to other users’ profiles via the search bar. When the owner visits their own profile, GitHub highlights the special repository named `SteveLodericks/SteveLodericks` at the top of their profile page. The default view on the repository page displays the rendered Markdown from `README.md`. The header shows the user’s name and tagline, followed by sections for About Me, Skills, Projects and Links, Badges, and Contact Information. A sidebar may present repository metadata such as stars, forks, and a link to clone the repo. The top navigation allows jumping to code, issues, pull requests, and settings.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a visitor scrolls through the page, each section appears in sequence and any links in the text open new browser tabs when clicked. Clicking a project link takes the user to the corresponding repository. Clicking a badge image opens the badge provider’s site in a new tab. For the repository owner, clicking the pencil icon in the Markdown viewer transitions to GitHub’s built-in file editor. There, they can make changes to the text, add or update badges and images, and write meaningful commit messages. Saving changes submits a pull request if the owner is working in a fork, or directly commits to the main branch if they have write access. After committing, GitHub redirects back to the repository view, showing updated content instantly. Alternatively, the owner may click the “Code” button to copy the HTTPS or SSH URL, clone the repository locally using a Git client, open the `README.md` file in an editor such as Visual Studio Code, apply edits, and push changes back to GitHub. Once the push completes, a page refresh reveals the new content.

## Settings and Account Management
Users access account settings through the avatar menu in the GitHub header. There they can update their profile photo, name, bio, and contact email. Users can also adjust notification preferences to watch or unwatch repositories. The repository owner navigates to the repository’s Settings tab to modify the description, topics, visibility, or to add a `.gitignore` file. From these settings pages, users can return to the main repository view by clicking the “Code” tab or the repository name link at the top of the page.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If an image link in the Markdown is broken or a badge URL returns 404, GitHub displays a broken image icon in place of the intended graphic. If Markdown syntax is incorrect, that section may not render as intended or could appear as raw text, prompting the owner to correct the formatting. When network connectivity is lost, GitHub pages may time out or fail to load; the user can retry or check their connection. If a non-owner tries to commit changes directly, they are presented with a fork prompt and may submit pull requests instead. Recovery from any of these states involves editing the Markdown to fix links, committing corrected code, or restoring connectivity.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
In summary, a typical visitor journey begins with landing on `github.com/SteveLodericks` and reading the static profile content rendered from `README.md`. If they wish to explore further, they click through links to projects or contact the owner via provided channels. The owner’s journey involves signing in, editing the README either through GitHub’s web editor or a local clone, and pushing updates to instantly refresh their public profile. Throughout, the flow remains straightforward, with each interaction clearly leading to the next, ensuring the profile serves as an effective digital resume and portfolio showcase.
