# Security Guideline Document for `SteveLodericks/SteveLodericks`

## 1. Purpose
This document provides security best practices and recommendations for the static GitHub profile repository `SteveLodericks/SteveLodericks`. Although this project contains only a single `README.md` file, adhering to strong security principles helps maintain content integrity, protect against misuse, and ensure that any external resources (badges, images) cannot be leveraged for attacks.

## 2. Threat Model
- **Malicious Content Injection**: An attacker (or compromised collaborator) might try to embed malicious links, scripts (in unsupported tags), or misleading content.
- **Compromise of External Resources**: Third-party badge or image services (e.g., shields.io) could serve malicious payloads if their infrastructure is compromised.
- **Account Takeover**: Unauthorized users gaining write access to the repository could deface the profile or expose sensitive data.
- **Information Leakage**: Accidentally publishing PII or credentials in the `README.md`.

## 3. Security Recommendations

### 3.1 Repository Permissions & Access Control
- **Least Privilege**: Grant write or admin permissions only to trusted collaborators. Use GitHub teams or individual invitations.
- **Branch Protection**: Enable protection on the default branch (`main` or `master`) to require reviews before merging any change.
- **MFA Enforcement**: Require multi-factor authentication for all organization members or for personal accounts with repository access.

### 3.2 Content Integrity & Input Validation
- **Markdown Sanitization**: Rely on GitHub’s built-in Markdown renderer, which strips unsupported HTML and JavaScript. Avoid embedding raw HTML tags that GitHub may not fully sanitize.
- **Review Process**: Always review pull requests to detect suspicious links, hidden text, or unintended disclosures.
- **No Secrets in README**: Never include API keys, credentials, or PII. Use environment variables or a secrets manager for sensitive data (though this repo should not hold any).

### 3.3 External Resources (Badges & Images)
- **Use Trusted Providers**: Only embed badges or images from reputable services such as `shields.io`, GitHub Content Delivery Network (raw.githubusercontent.com), or your own static asset host.
- **HTTPS Only**: Always reference external resources via `https://` URLs to enforce TLS encryption.
- **Integrity Checks**: Where possible, use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for externally hosted scripts or styles—but note that SRI is not supported in Markdown; best practice is to host static assets in the same repository or a trusted CDN.
- **File Size and Dimensions**: Optimize image sizes (<200 KB) and specify dimensions to prevent layout shifts or performance issues.

### 3.4 Data Protection & Privacy
- **Minimal Personal Data**: Limit contact info to business‐appropriate channels (e.g., professional email). Avoid posting sensitive personal identifiers or home addresses.
- **No Logging of Sensitive Data**: Since this is a public, static page, there is no logging. However, ensure that any contact links (e.g., mailto) do not expose private mailing lists or internal systems.

### 3.5 Infrastructure & Delivery
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: GitHub serves all repositories over TLS (minimum TLS 1.2). Confirm that any custom domains (if used) also enforce HTTPS with HSTS.
- **GitHub Security Settings**: Enable GitHub’s security features such as Dependabot alerts, security advisories, and vulnerability scanning—even if this repo has no code dependencies.

### 3.6 Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Audit History**: Regularly review the repository’s commit history and collaborator access logs for unusual activity.
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Although this repo has no external code dependencies, monitor any future additions (e.g., action workflows) for outdated or vulnerable versions.
- **Periodic Review**: Schedule a quarterly check to verify that all linked resources are still secure, images load correctly, and no unintended content has been added.

### 3.7 Incident Response & Recovery
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep a clean, known-good tag or branch (e.g., `v1.0‐profile‐baseline`) to quickly revert in case of defacement.
- **Notification Workflow**: If unauthorized changes are detected, immediately remove write access, revert malicious commits, and notify GitHub support if necessary.

## 4. Conclusion
Adopting these security practices ensures that the `SteveLodericks/SteveLodericks` repository remains a safe, trustworthy showcase. Even for a static Markdown profile, enforcing principle of least privilege, reviewing content changes, and monitoring external resources helps mitigate risk and protect both the user’s reputation and visitors’ trust.
