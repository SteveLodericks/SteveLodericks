# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

**Paragraph 1:**
This project delivers a personalized, static GitHub profile page for the user **SteveLodericks**. By leveraging GitHub’s special repository naming convention (where the repo name matches the username), the content in a single `README.md` file is prominently displayed on the user’s public profile. The page serves as a digital resume: it introduces Steve, highlights his technical skills (Python, C#, Java), and provides clear contact information.

**Paragraph 2:**
We’re building this to give visitors an immediate, polished overview of Steve’s background, expertise, and interests—without installing anything or navigating away from GitHub. Success means that anyone landing on Steve’s profile can quickly grasp his strengths, reach out if they wish, and explore linked projects or resources. The page must be easy to update, visually clean, and fully rendered by GitHub’s Markdown engine.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope (Version 1):**
- A single `README.md` file at the repository root.
- Sections for: 
  - Header/Title (Steve’s name and tagline)
  - About Me (brief bio)
  - Skills (Python, C#, Java, etc.)
  - Contact Info (email, LinkedIn, Twitter)
  - Links to key projects or portfolios
  - Badges for e.g. GitHub stats or tech stacks (via shields.io)
- Optional profile banner or avatar image via Markdown image link.
- Proper Markdown formatting so GitHub renders it natively.

**Out-of-Scope:**
- Any client-side or server-side code (no HTML/CSS/JS beyond embedded Markdown).
- Dynamic data fetching, APIs, or authentication flows.
- Additional repository files (scripts, config files) beyond minimal `.gitignore` (optional).
- Hosting on platforms outside of GitHub (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

## 3. User Flow

**Visitor Journey:**
1. A visitor navigates to `https://github.com/SteveLodericks`.  
2. GitHub recognizes this repository as a special profile repo and displays the `README.md` content right on the profile page.  
3. The visitor scrolls through sections—reading the header, bio, skill list, and clicking on any links or badges to explore further (personal site, project repos, LinkedIn, etc.).  
4. If interested, they use the contact information to reach out or star/follow the profile.

**Maintainer Journey:**
1. Steve clones the repo locally or edits `README.md` via the GitHub web UI.  
2. He updates text, adds new projects, or adjusts badges/images in Markdown.  
3. He commits and pushes changes; GitHub instantly renders the new content on his profile.  
4. He periodically reviews and refines content to keep it up to date.

## 4. Core Features

- **Special Repo Recognition**: Repo named exactly `SteveLodericks/SteveLodericks` to trigger GitHub profile display.
- **Markdown Content Layout**:
  - **Header**: Name & tagline.
  - **About Me**: Short bio paragraph.
  - **Skills**: Bullet list of technical proficiencies.
  - **Projects/Links**: Clickable links to highlight key work.
  - **Badges**: GitHub stats, language usage, etc., via shields.io.
  - **Contact**: Email and social media handles.
  - **Images**: Profile picture or banner (optional) with alt text.
- **Ease of Editing**: Clear Markdown sections labeled with headings for straightforward updates.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Core Format**: Markdown (`README.md`).
- **Platform**: GitHub (special profile repository feature).
- **Badge Service**: [shields.io](https://shields.io/) for dynamic badge images.
- **Editing Tools (optional)**:
  - Visual Studio Code with Markdown preview.
  - GitHub’s built-in web editor.
  - Any plain-text editor.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Instant load—static content only.  
- **Usability**: Clean, readable headings and lists; mobile-responsive in GitHub’s UI.  
- **Accessibility**: Use alt text for images; sufficient contrast in any images used.  
- **Maintainability**: Single-file structure for easy updates; use clear Markdown section headings.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Repo Naming**: Must remain `SteveLodericks/SteveLodericks` for GitHub to display it on the profile.  
- **Format**: Content must stay in Markdown; GitHub’s flavor. No external hosting.  
- **Services Availability**: shields.io uptime assumed for badge images.  
- **User Assumption**: Steve can write or update Markdown; no special tooling required.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **GitHub’s Markdown Variations**: Some Markdown extensions (HTML tags, custom CSS) aren’t supported.  
  *Mitigation:* Stick to standard GitHub Markdown (headings, lists, images, links).  
- **Badge Link Breakage**: External badge URLs can 404 if shields.io changes.  
  *Mitigation:* Periodically verify badge URLs or host fallback images.  
- **Large Images**: Oversized banners slow page load or display poorly on mobile.  
  *Mitigation:* Optimize images for web (under 200 KB, correct dimensions).  
- **Long README**: Extremely lengthy content may deter readers.  
  *Mitigation:* Keep sections concise; consider collapsible details (GitHub details tag).

This PRD provides a clear, no-ambiguity blueprint for creating and maintaining **SteveLodericks**’ GitHub profile page. With this in place, the AI can generate style guidelines, file structure docs, and further technical artifacts without missing details.
