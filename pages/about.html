                <div class="about-text">
                    <h2>Welcome, I'm Nicoline</h2>
                    <p>For over a decade, I've been deeply committed to understanding the profound connection between our minds, bodies, and spirits. My journey into somatic coaching began with my own healing process – a path that led me from feeling disconnected and overwhelmed to discovering the incredible wisdom that lives within our bodies.</p>
                    
                    <p>Based in the beautiful city of The Hague, I work with individuals who are ready to embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery and healing. My approach is rooted in the understanding that our bodies hold the keys to our healing – we simply need to learn how to listen.</p>

                    <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>I believe that healing happens not through doing, but through being. In our fast-paced world, we've learned to override our body's signals, to push through discomfort, and to live primarily in our minds. Somatic coaching offers a gentle yet powerful way to return home to ourselves.</p>

                    <p>Through somatic awareness, we can:</p>
                    <ul class="philosophy-list">
                        <li>Reconnect with our body's natural wisdom and intelligence</li>
                        <li>Release trauma and tension held in our nervous system</li>
                        <li>Develop greater emotional regulation and resilience</li>
                        <li>Cultivate a sense of safety and presence in our bodies</li>
                        <li>Access our authentic voice and personal power</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>My Personal Journey</h3>
                    <p>My path to becoming a somatic coach was deeply personal. After experiencing my own journey through anxiety, chronic stress, and feeling disconnected from my body, I discovered the transformative power of somatic work. This personal experience of healing gives me deep empathy and understanding for what my clients are experiencing.</p>

                    <p>I understand what it's like to feel stuck, overwhelmed, or disconnected. I also know the profound relief and empowerment that comes from learning to trust your body's wisdom again. This lived experience, combined with my professional training, allows me to hold a safe and compassionate space for your healing journey.</p>
